This is more than just a place to dump code. It's my personal diary documenting the highs, the lows, and the "Aha!" moments of my coding journey. 

**Here is what you will find:**
* **🧩 LeetCode Solutions:** My approaches, optimized code, and time/space complexity notes.
* **📓 Daily Entries:** What I learned, where I struggled, and general life updates.
* **📈 Progress Tracking:** Watching myself grow from brute-force beginner to optimized problem solver.

## 📂 Folder Structure
