My first Leetcode Question  
1 January 2026

1. Two Sum

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int> &nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> hash;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (hash.find(complement) != hash.end()) {
                return {hash[complement], i};
            }
            hash[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        // Return an empty vector if no solution is found
        return {};
    }
};

i dont know how to express this feelings its just result is about to come and i am very stressed out like i know i did well this time did some blunders but i am proud of myself and incoming semesters will
do much better
i hope you can take the results
